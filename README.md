### <h3>eddy.CSS<h3>

<hr>

### The idea behind this:

- eddy.css is a fork of sakura.css with some changes
- i loved this theme so i thought to just push it as a micro-library so that it will be easier for me to maintain and maybe someone else could use it too (if they like it)

### ⚡️ Installation:

- paste the following code in the head section of your html file and you are good to go
- ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/niiirav/eddy-css@main/css/eddy.min.css">```

### ⏩ Change Log:

- Check CHANGELOG.md for more informations.

### 🙏 Credits:

- <a link="https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura/"> sakura.css </a> for the base code
